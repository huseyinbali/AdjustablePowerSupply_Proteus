# AdjustablePowerSupply_Proteus
There are made adjustable power supply and PCB design in this project.
DC signals are generally preferred to run electrical circuits.Also dc signals generally run low voltage values for this reason voltage values of ac signals are reduced to more low values.
This transaction are made use transformator. AC signals continue to come at the transformer output.
Diodes are using for convert the AC signals to DC signals.Becasuse,diodes are pass current one direction.
These circuits are called Rectifier circuits.There are wavy DC signals at the output of the rectifier circuits.
Filter circuits are used to generate constant values of signals.Capasitor are generally used in filter circuits.
However, filter circuits are affected by changes in input signals and load changes in the circuit.
Therefore, regulation circuits are used to ensure that the output voltage value always takes a constant value independent of the load and the input signal.
Zener diode,transistor or regulation ICs can be used in regulated circuits.
I was used 7812 integrated for +12V DC ,7805 integrated for +5V DC,7912 integrated for -12V DC ,7905 integrated for -5V DC  and LM317T integrated for 0-15V DC adjustable power supply.
Also, there are 2*(12V AC) and 24V AC values at transformator output and 220V AC at transformator input too.
